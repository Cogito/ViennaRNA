	* change Make_bp_profile() and profile_edit_distance() to use
	  simple (float *) arrays; makes Perl access much easier.
	  RNApdist -B now works again

2002-10-28  Ivo Hofacker  <ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at>

	* Improved Perl module with pod documentation; allow to write
	  things like
	  ($structure, $energy) = RNA::fold($seq);
	  Compatibility warning: the ptrvalue() and related functions are
	  gone, see the pod documentation for alternatives.

	* added svg structure plots in PS_dot.c and RNAplot

	* Improve reading of clustal files (alifold)
	* add a sample alifold.cgi script

2001-09-18  Ivo Hofacker  <ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at>

	* moved suboptimal folding into the library, thus it's now
	  accessible from the Perl module

2001-08-31  Ivo Hofacker  <ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at>

	* added co-folding support in energy_of_struct(), and thus RNAeval

	* switch from handcrafted makefiles to automake and autoconf

2001-04-05  Ivo Hofacker  <ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at>

	* added PS_rna_plot_a to produce structure plots with annotation

	* add alifold; predict consensus structures from alignment
