Installation:

To compile this package you need a compiler that understands ANSI C.

Check the makefiles in the subdirectories, and edit the
CC CFLAGS BINDIR MANDIR and LIBDIR variables to suit your system.

Type
        make all
to produce the library and the interactive programs, and
        make install
to copy the executables, library and man pages into the appropriate
directories. You may also want to install the header files in ./H in
a suitable place. This is not done by the makefile. Also feel free to
copy all header files into a single one, if you dislike using a lot of
#includes in your programs.

There are man pages for all executables, the library is documented in
./man/RNAlib.texinfo. You can either print this file as a manual using
TeX (if you don't have texinfo.tex installed use the .dvi file) or use
it as online documentation if you have the GNU texinfo package installed.
Documentation in HTML can be found at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA.


System specific notes:
calculating the partition function for long sequences ( >600 bases)
generates a lot of floating point underflows. On some system this can slow
down the calculation dramatically because an exception is invoked for each 
underflow. How to avoid this problem is highly system specific:

On SunOS 4.1 the remedy is calling nonstandard_arithmetic() add a -DSUN4 to
the CFLAGS in lib/makefile to do this. Use CC=gcc since SUN's standard cc
doesn't understand ANSI C.

On HP700/800 maschines running hpux9 add -DHP9 to the CFLAGS so that
fpsetfastmode() will be called.

On SGIs running IRIX 5 add -lfpe to the link flags in Progs/makefile
and set the environment variable TRAP_FPE to "UNDERFL=FLUSH_ZERO" before 
running RNAfold. See  `man 3 handle_sigfpes`  for details.

Nothing special has to be done for AIX and OSF/1.

If you want to fold sequences several 1000 bases in length and have you
have lots of memory you may want to add -DPF_LARGE to the CFLAGS so that
all partition function folding will use double precision floats (needing
twice the amount of memory).
