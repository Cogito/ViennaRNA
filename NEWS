Some Changes relative to ViennaRNA-1.03

New energy parameters used in the folding routines.
Prediction of minimum free energy structures now includes contributions
from terminal unpaired nucleotides (so called dangling ends).
The partition function treats these contributions approximately.

Energies for GU pairs in are now taken from
L. He et al., Biochemistry 1991, 30, p 11124

Bulges of length 1 now get an additional stacking energy.

The folding routines accept  a list of nonstandard basepairs that should be
allowed to occur. Also, when doing constrained folding, forced pairs will
be honoured even if the pair is usally not allowed (not AU, GC, or GU).
RNAeval should be useful now for structures containing nonstandard pairs.

Some support for constrained folding using partition function: A constraint
of the form i-j must pair or i must not pair will be honoured by disallowing 
all pairs conflicting with the constraint.

Both folding algorthms use less memory and should be a bit faster for long
sequences.

Several smaller bug fixes.
