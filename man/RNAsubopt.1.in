.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBRNAsubopt [\-e\ \fIrange\fP] [\-ep prange] [\-s] [\-T\ \fItemp\fP] [\-d[0|1|2|3]] [\-4] [\-noGU] [\-noCloseGU] [\-P\ paramfile] [\-logML] [\-nsp\ pairs]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I RNAsubopt 
reads RNA sequences from stdin and calculates all suboptimal secondary
structures within a user defined energy range above the minimum free
energy (mfe). It prints the suboptimal structures in bracket notation
followed by the energy in kcal/mol to stdout.
The number of structures returned typically grows exponentially with both 
sequence length and energy range.
.SH OPTIONS
.B \-e\ \fIrange\fP
Calculate suboptimal structures within \fIrange\fP kcal/mol of the mfe. 
Default is 1.
.TP
.B \-s
Sort the structures by energy. Since the sort in is done in memory,
this becomes inparctical when the number of structures produced goes
into millions. In such cases better pipe the output through `sort +1n'. 
.TP
.B \-d[0|1|2|3]
Change treatment of dangling ends, as in RNAfold and RNAeval.  The
default is -d2 (as in partition function folding). If -d1 or -d3 are
specified the structures are generated as with -d2 but energies are
re-evaluated before printing.
.TP
.B \-logML
re-calculate energies of structures using a logarithmic energy function for
multi-loops before output. This option does not effect structure
generation, only the energies that is printed out. Since logML lowers
energies somewhat, some structures may be missing.
.TP
.B \-ep \fIprange\fP
Only print structures with energy within prange of the mfe. Useful in
conjunction with -logML, -d1 or -d3: while the -e option specifies the
range before energies are re-evaluate, -ep specifies the maimum energy
atfer re-evaluation.
.TP
.B \-noLP
Only produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). This
reduces the number of structures drastically and should therefore be used
for longer sequences and larger energy ranges.
.PP
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP, 
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in RNAfold.
.TP
