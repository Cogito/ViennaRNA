This is Version 1.1 of the Vienna RNA Package.
----------------------------------------------

It consists of a few stand alone programs and a library that you can
link your own programs with. The package allows you to

- predict minimum free energy secondary structures
- calculate the partition function for the ensemble of structures
- predict melting curves
- search for sequences folding into a given structure
- compare secondary structures including pairwise alignment.

There is also a set of programs for analysing sequence and distance
data using split decomposition, statistical geometry, and cluster methods.
This part of the package has not yet been tested extensively.

The package is known to compile under
SunOS 4.1, AIX 3.2, hpux8 and hpux9, IRIX 4.05 and IRIX 5, DEC OSF/1 and linux.
Porting to other UN*X flavours should present no problems.
You need a compiler that understands ANSI C.

The following executables are provided:
RNAfold		predict secondary structures
RNAeval		evaluate energy for given sequence and structure
RNAheat		calculate melting curves
RNAdistance	compare secondary structures
RNApdist	compare ensembles of secondary structures
RNAinverse	find sequences folding into given structures
AnalyseSeqs	analyse sequence data
AnalyseDists	analyse distance matrices

All executables read from and write to stdout and use command line
switches rather than menus to be easily usable in pipes.

For more detailed information see the man pages.

We have included a patched version of D.G. Gilbert's readseq program
for those who often process sequence files from databanks. See the
the documentation in that directory for details.

If you need structures in the form of ".ct" files as produced by 
Michael Zukers mfold Program, you'll find a small program b2ct.c to 
convert the output of our RNAfold in the Utils directory.
