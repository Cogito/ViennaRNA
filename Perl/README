This is an experimental perl 5 interface to the Vienna RNA library, generated
using Dave Beazley incredibly useful interface generator SWIG. See
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG/
It has been tested under perl 5.004 on SGI IBM and Linux.

Installation:
compile by typing
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
to test the module type
	make test
if no tests fail install using
	make install

As example programs we provide a perl version of the usual RNAfold program,
RNAfold.pl, and a cgi-script for RNA folding on the web. 
The cgi-script uses the modules CGI  HTML URI and Chart in addition to the 
RNA module. These modules are available from your nearest CPAN site or 
http://www.perl.org/. 
To install the cgi-script simply copy RNAfold.cgi to an appropriate place 
on your web server such as the /cgi-bin directory, create a directory to hold
the output files produced by the script and edit the $hdir variable 
accordingly. 

You may have to adjust the path to your perl interpreter in the two scripts.
