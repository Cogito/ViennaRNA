This directory contains a new perl 5 interface to the Vienna RNA library, 
generated using Dave Beazley's incredibly useful interface generator SWIG.
See  http://www.swig.org/
The perl RNA module lets you access all functions of the Vienna RNA library
directly from your perl scripts. 
It has been tested under perl 5.004 on SGIs, IBMs, and Linux machines.

Installation:
compile by typing
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
to test the module type
	make test
if no tests fail install using
	make install

SWIG generated documentation can be found in RNA_wrap.html.

As example programs we provide a perl version of the usual RNAfold program,
RNAfold.pl, and a cgi-script for RNA folding on the web (Go to 
http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi to see the script in action).
The cgi-script uses the modules CGI  HTML URI and Chart in addition to the 
RNA module. These modules are available from your nearest CPAN site or 
http://www.perl.org/. 
To install the cgi-script simply copy RNAfold.cgi to an appropriate place 
on your web server such as the /cgi-bin directory, create a directory to hold
the output files produced by the script and edit the $hdir variable 
accordingly. 

You may have to adjust the path to your perl interpreter in the two scripts.
