Version 1.3.1
-----------
RNAheat would produce spikes in the specific heat because dangling end
energies did not go smoothly to 0. 
PS dot plots now have an option to use a log scale (edit _dp.ps file
and set logscale to true).

Version 1.3
-----------
Secondary structure plots now use E. Bruccoleri's naview routines for
layout by default. New utility RNAplot produces secondary structure plots 
from structures in bracket notation with several options.
-d2 option in RNAfold and RNAeval sets dangles=2, which makes 
energy_of_struct() and fold() treat dangling ends as in pf_fold().
-noLP option in RNAfold etc sets noLonelyPairs=1, which avoids most
structures containing lonely base pairs (helices of length 1).

new utility functions pack_structure() unpack_structure() make_pair_table()
and bp_distance().  RNAdistance adds bp_distance() via -DP switch.

First release of RNAsubopt for complete suboptimal folding.

fixed bug in asymetry penalty for interior loops. 

Default compilation now uses doubles for partition function folding.

Version 1.2.1
-------------
Fixed bug in version 1.2 of the RNAheat program causing overflow errors
for most input sequences. 
The PS_dot_plot() and PS_rna_plot() routines now return an int. The return 
value is 0 if the file could not be written, 1 otherwise.
This version contains the alpha version of a perl5 module, which let's you
access all the capabilities of the Vienna RNA library from perl scripts.
See the README file in the Perl directory for details.


Version 1.2
-----------
New energy parameters from (Walter et.al 1994). 
Energy parameters can be read from file.
RNAeval and energy_of_struct() support logarithmic energy function for 
multi-loops.
gmlRNA() produces secondary structure drawing in gml (Graph Meta Language). 
Many bug fixes.
