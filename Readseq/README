This directory contains sources to the readseq program by d.g.gilbert.
It is not part of this package.
We have taken the liberty to add the comma free form used by our package
as 19th output format. The new output format is selected by using the 
-f=19 or -f=vienna  option.

Example:
readseq -f=19 -a file_in_some_strange_format | RNAfold | RNAdistance -Xm -Dh | AnalyseDists -Xn

will convert all sequences in the file, fold them, calculate all pair distances between the resulting secondary structures and construct a phylogentic tree of the structures using the neighbour joining algorithm.
