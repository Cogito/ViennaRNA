Installation:

To compile this package you need a compiler that understands ANSI C.

Check the makefiles in the subdirectories, and edit the
CC CFLAGS BINDIR MANDIR and LIBDIR variables to suit your system.

Type
        make all
to build the library and the programs in the ./Progs, ./Cluster and ./Utils 
directories.
Type
        make install
to copy the executables in ./Progs and ./Cluster, the library and man
pages into the appropriate directories (as defined by the BINDIR MANDIR
and LIBDIR variables). 
Files in the ./Utils directory will not be installed automatically. 
If you plan on using the library, you'll also want to install the header 
files from ./H in a suitable place. This is not done by the makefile. 
Also feel free to copy all header files into a single one, if you dislike 
using a lot of #includes in your programs.

To build and install the Perl module, the RNAsubopt, or readseq program,
follow the instructions in the respective directories.

There are man pages for all executables, the library is documented in
./man/RNAlib.texinfo. You can either print this file as a manual using
TeX (if you don't have texinfo.tex installed use the .dvi file) or use
it as online documentation if you have the GNU texinfo package installed.
Documentation in HTML can be found at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/


System specific notes:
calculating the partition function for long sequences ( >400 bases)
generates a lot of floating point underflows. On some system this can slow
down the calculation dramatically because an exception is invoked for each 
underflow. How to avoid this problem is highly system specific:

On SunOS 4.1 the remedy is calling nonstandard_arithmetic() add a -DSUN4 to
the CFLAGS in lib/makefile to do this. Use CC=gcc since SUN's standard cc
doesn't understand ANSI C.

On HP machines running hpux-9 or hpux-10 add -DHP9 to the CFLAGS so that
fpsetfastmode() will be called.

Nothing special has to be done for AIX-3.2 and OSF/1. 

Partition function folding (via RNAfold -p) of long sequences can fail
because of overflow errors. To avoid this double precision floating point 
numbers can be used at the expense of doubling memory requirements.
If your machine has little memory and you dont't plan to fold sequences
several 1000 bases in length you can compile the package to do the compautions 
in single precision by editing the file ./H/fold_vars.h and deleting the second 
line, which normally reads
#define LARGE_PF

Memory requirements for a sequence of length n will be approximately
12*n^2 bytes for RNAfold -p in the double precision version, and
 4*n^2 bytes for the minimum free energy alone.
