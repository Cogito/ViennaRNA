This directory contains a few scripts, you might find useful. They're not 
installed by default.

Fold	automatically converts sequence files from databanks using readseq
	and feeds the converted sequence to RNAfold

b2ct.c  converts the bracket notation produced by RNAfold into an '.ct' file,
	as produced by Zukers mfold. 

b2mt.pl	perl script that converts a secondary structure in bracket notation 
	into a list of x y values that can be plotted to obtain the 
	"mountain"-representation of an RNA secondary structure. E.g.:
	RNAfold < foo.seq | b2mt.pl | xmgr -pipe

mountain.pl
	produces a generalized mountain presentation from the base pair 
	probabilities contained in an PostScript dotplot. E.g:
	RNAfold < foo.seq; mountain.pl dot.ps | xmgr -pipe

dpzoom.pl	extract a portion of a dot plot produced by RNAfold -p
	e.g.: to extract the structure of bases 7361 to 7600 from the folding 
	of a complete HIV sequence use
		dpzoom.pl -f 7361 -l 7600 HIV_dp.ps > RRE_dp.ps
