This directory contains the first release of software for calculating
all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the minimum
free energy (mfe). The approach is quite different from other programs 
for suboptimal folding like Michael Zuker's mfold: While mfold tries to
generate a (small) representative sample of structures, we generate every
possible structure in the energy range. Be warned that it is easy to
generate more structures than your computer can handle.

A manuscript describing the method and sample applications can 
be found at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/papers/98wplist.html

As this program program is fairly new, expect more bugs than in other
parts of the package.

Just type  make  to build the RNAsubopt program (be sure you built the
rest of the package first by typing make in the parent directory).

See the man page RNAsubopt.man for more information.
