This is Version 1.4 of the Vienna RNA Package.
------------------------------------------------
See the CHANGES file for differences to previous versions.

The Vienna RNA packages consists of a few stand alone programs and a 
library that you can link your own programs with. The package allows you to

- predict minimum free energy secondary structures
- calculate the partition function for the ensemble of structures
- calculate suboptimal structures in given energy range
- predict melting curves
- search for sequences folding into a given structure
- compare secondary structures including pairwise alignment.

There is also a set of programs for analysing sequence and distance
data using split decomposition, statistical geometry, and cluster methods.

This version contains a Perl 5 module that allows to access all functions
of the library from perl scripts, see the Perl subdirectory. 
In addition a new program for calculating all suboptimal structures within 
a given energy range can be found in the Subopt directory.

Please read the copyright notice in the file COPYING.

The package is known to compile under
SunOS 4.1, AIX 3.2, hpux8 and hpux9, IRIX 4.05 and IRIX 5, DEC OSF/1 and linux.
Other UN*X flavours should present no problems. Several people have 
reported successful compiles under Windows.
You need a compiler that understands ANSI C. See the INSTALL file for details.

The following executables are provided:
RNAfold		predict secondary structures
RNAsubopt	calulate suboptimal structures in a given energy range
RNAeval		evaluate energy for given sequence and structure
RNAheat		calculate melting curves
RNAdistance	compare secondary structures
RNApdist	compare ensembles of secondary structures
RNAinverse	find sequences folding into given structures
AnalyseSeqs	analyse sequence data
AnalyseDists	analyse distance matrices

The RNAplot program and other useful utililities can be found in the 
Utils directory.

All executables read from stdin and write to stdout and use command line
switches rather than menus to be easily usable in pipes.

For more detailed information see the man pages.

We have included a patched version of D.G. Gilbert's readseq program
for those who often process sequence files from databanks. See the
the documentation in that directory for details.


Versions since 1.4 feature new energy parameters as described in Mathews
et.al, JMB, 1999. For backward compatibility a parameter file with the
version 1.3 parameter set (as described in Walter et.al (1994)) can be
found in the file vienna13.par. The standard energy set is compiled in, but
can also be found in the file default.par. Note that only free energies at
37C are new. Temperature dependencies are still derived from the old
parameter set.
The code very rarely uses static arrays, and all programs should work for 
sequences up to a length of  32700 (if you have huge amounts of memory that
is).

If you're a commercial user and find these programs useful, please consider
